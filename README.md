# password generator
 
On this project we got a html file with a resposible bootstrap css. And we had to add a js file that generated a password for the user. When the user clicks on generate password, some promps ask him if he wants uppercases, lowercases, special character and numbers. When he awnsers to all the prompts, the js gets all the arrays with different kinds of charracters and put the choosen togheter. after that we randomize the password and print that on the screen.
